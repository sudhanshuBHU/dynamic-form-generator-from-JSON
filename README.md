## Local Development Guide

### Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.
  - `components/`: Reusable React components.
  - `styles/`: CSS and styling files.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.

### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev ` or `yarn run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test` or `yarn test`: Launches the test runner.
- `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run eject` or `yarn eject`: Ejects the app configuration (use with caution).

### Creating a New Component
1. Create a new file in the `src/components/` directory.
2. Define your component:
  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';

  const MyComponent = () => {
    return (
     <div>
      {/* Your component code */}
     </div>
    );
  };

  export default MyComponent;
  ```

3. Import and use your component in the desired location:
  ```jsx
  import MyComponent from './components/MyComponent';

  const App = () => {
    return (
     <div>
      <MyComponent />
     </div>
    );
  };

  export default App;
  ```

### Styling
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for scoped styling.
- Global styles can be added in the `src/styles/` directory.

### Testing
- Write tests in the `src/__tests__/` directory.
- Use `jest` and `react-testing-library` for unit and integration tests.
